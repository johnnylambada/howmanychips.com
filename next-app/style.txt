General App Design for "howmanychips.com"
Overall Aesthetic
Theme: Poker-inspired with a subtle green felt background, evoking a casino table vibe, paired with a clean, modern layout.
Motif: Poker elements (chips, cards) used sparingly as accents to reinforce the brand without overwhelming functionality.
Tone: Professional yet approachable—practical tools for poker players with a hint of fun.
Layout Structure
1. Header (Fixed, Global Component)
Height: 80px (fixed position, stays at the top when scrolling).
Background: Dark gray (#424242) to contrast the felt body.
Content:
Left: Logo ("HowManyChips.com") in white, bold Roboto font, 24px size.
Accent: Small poker chip stack icon (red/white/black, ~30px) to the left of the text, animated with a slight bounce on page load (using CSS or Framer Motion).
Right: Navigation menu in white, 16px Roboto font.
Links: "Home | Chip Calculator | Tournament Tools | About | Tips" (dynamic based on pages you add).
Hover Effect: Links turn red (#D32F2F) with a 0.3s transition.
Mobile: Collapses into a hamburger menu (white icon, 30px) at <768px, opening a full-screen dark gray dropdown with vertical links.
Border: Thin bottom line in green (#2E7D32) for a poker table edge feel.
Next.js Implementation: Create a <Header /> component in components/Header.js, styled with CSS modules or Tailwind CSS.
2. Main Content Area (Flexible, Page-Specific Container)
Background: Light gray (#F5F5F5) base with a subtle green felt texture (opacity 10%) applied via a CSS background image.
Texture: Use a repeating green felt pattern (e.g., sourced from a free stock site like Unsplash or created as a 100x100px tile in PNG).
Example CSS: background: url('/felt-texture.png') repeat, #F5F5F5;
Layout: Two-column design on desktop (>768px), single-column on mobile.
Left Column (70% width, ~840px at 1200px screen):
Holds the main content (e.g., calculators, forms, results).
Wrapped in a white card (#FFFFFF) with 10px padding, 2px gray border (#E0E0E0), and slight shadow (box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)).
Max-width: 90% on mobile, centered.
Right Column (30% width, ~360px at 1200px screen):
Sidebar for ads and supplementary info.
Stacks below main content on mobile (<768px).
Spacing:
20px margin between header and content.
20px padding around the container edges.
Next.js Implementation: Use a <Layout /> component in components/Layout.js with a <main> tag for page content and a <Sidebar /> component for the right column.
3. Footer (Global Component)
Height: 80px.
Background: Dark gray (#424242), matching the header.
Content:
Centered white text, 14px Roboto: "© 2025 HowManyChips.com | Home | Chip Calculator | Tournament Tools | About | Tips."
Accent: Small poker chip stack icon (same as header) on the right, static.
Mobile: Text wraps to two lines if needed, icon stays right-aligned.
Next.js Implementation: Create a <Footer /> component in components/Footer.js.

Poker Motif Elements
Icons:
Poker chips (red/white/black stack) in header and footer.
Optional: Card suits (spades, hearts) as subtle bullet points or button icons.
Source: FontAwesome (fa-coins, fa-heart) or custom SVGs.
Animations:
Chip stack in header bounces once on load (e.g., keyframes in CSS or Framer Motion).
Buttons scale slightly on hover (e.g., transform: scale(1.05)).
Borders: Thin green lines (#2E7D32) mimic table edges (header bottom, card outlines).
Next.js Implementation: Store icons in public/icons/ and use in components via <Image /> or inline SVG.
Interactive Elements

Primary: Green (#2E7D32), white text, 200px wide, 40px tall, 5px rounded corners.
Hover: Darker green (#1B5E20).
Secondary: Red outline (#D32F2F), transparent fill, red text.
Hover: Red fill, white text.
Forms:
Inputs: White background, 2px gray border (#E0E0E0), 200px wide, 40px tall.
Labels: Black, 16px Roboto, 5px above inputs.

AdSense Integration
Sidebar:
Desktop: 300x600px skyscraper ad in the right column, labeled "Advertisement" in a gray placeholder until approved.
Mobile: Switches to 300x250px banner below main content.
Placement: Avoid clutter—keep ads in the sidebar or below results, not between inputs and outputs.
Next.js Implementation: Use a <AdSlot /> component with conditional rendering based on screen size (via useMediaQuery or CSS).
Responsiveness
Breakpoints:
Desktop (>768px): Two-column layout, full header.
Mobile (<768px): Single-column, stacked content, hamburger menu.
Adjustments:
Main content cards: 90% width on mobile, centered.
Sidebar: Moves below main content, ad resizes.
Text: Reduces slightly (e.g., titles 24px, body 14px) for readability.
Next.js Implementation: Use CSS media queries or Tailwind’s responsive classes (e.g., md:flex-row flex-col).
Technical Notes for Next.js
File Structure:
components/Header.js, Footer.js, Layout.js, Sidebar.js for reusable parts.
pages/_app.js: Global styles and font import.
public/felt-texture.png: Background texture.
Styling:
Tailwind CSS (recommended): Add to Next.js via npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer, then configure in tailwind.config.js.
CSS Modules: Alternative, scope styles to components (e.g., Header.module.css).
Assets: Store poker chip SVGs/icons in public/icons/.
Performance: Use Next.js <Image /> for optimized loading of the felt texture and icons.
